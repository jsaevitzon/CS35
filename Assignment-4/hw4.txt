cd sI made a new branch by running the commnad 
"git checkout v3.0 -b quote"

I installed the change into this new branch by
running "patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt"
It patched 6 files:
src/cmp.c
src/diff.c
src/diff3.c
src/dir.c
src/sdiff.c
src/util.c
I typed "y" for each promp to assume -R.


I opened ChangeLog-2008 in emacs and added what I changed using "C-x 4-a". I noticed that, after closing emacs, what I wrote appeared in ChangeLog.

I then used "git add ." and "git commit -F ChangeLog" to commit the changes.

I used "git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt" to generate the file formatted-patch.txt.

I switched to a new branch by running "git checkout v3.0 -b test" and 
ran the command "git am < formatted-patch.txt" to apply. Then I ran
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check
I then tested that the patch worked, and it did.

I did the same for my partner's, Patrick's, formatted-patch.txt. And his did not work. So we
spoke again and he is sending it to me again later.

I then used "make distdir" to check the diffutils*/Changelog files and the changes were there.

I went to  ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs and ran the command 'gitk'. I found the file
date 2015-01-24 and took a screenshot. Then wrote a description.
