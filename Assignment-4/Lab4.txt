1.cloned the repository using:
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git

2. Copied the changes into the file using:
git log >git-log.txt

3.Generated a list of tags using:
git tag >git-tags.txt

4. I used the command git log --grep="maint: quote".
The output showed the commit was "62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f"

5.Checked out the version 3.0 by:
git checkout v3.0. Which put me in
'detatched head state'.

6. I applied the patch by using the command:
"git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt"
and "patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt". I skipped over the files that 
were unable to find the correct patch.

7. I used "git status" to get an overview of what happened,
It shows me all the modified and untracked files.

8. I practiced the commands on other files I made. Particularly
 "C-x v =", "C-x v u", "C-c C-a" and "C-c C-c"

9. I reverted all the non-c files. Then went back and
changed each of the files that were rejected. I made sure to 
keep only the desired changes in each of the .c files, deleting
all other changes.

10. I opened the rejected "src/*.c.rej" files and manually copied
the rejected patches into the corresponding c files. It seemed to be
mostly comments.

11. I removed all the untracked files with "git clean -f"
Now "git status" only reports the six modified files.

12. git status reports 6 modified files.
I used the command "git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt" to copy
the outputted lines by diff to this new text file.

13. I then read the README-hacking file and inputted the following:
(before running this, I went into stdio.in.h and made the
necessary changes from the given patch)
1. ./bootstrap
2  ./configure
3. make
4. make check

 I verified that the diff command works properly by using the 
command "./diff . -" and the outoutter result was:
"./diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory", with single quotes.
Also, ./diff --help and ./diff --help3 outputted with all format correct.

I created the directories by running "git clone git:://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git diffutils-3.0"
I then went into that folder and checked out version 3.0. I then went back to the upper folder
and ran the command "./src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0/ diffutils-3.0-patch/ > quote-3.0-test.txt""
To compare the patch to the source code.

I then ran the diff command to compare quote-3.0-test.txt to quote-3.0-patch.txt. There
are quite a few differences, and the changes are not innocous.
