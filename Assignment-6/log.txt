I used the cd to boot ubuntu on the computer.

Ran the command dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh install.
The result was : 

openssh-client

So I ran: sudo apt-get install openssh-server to install
the server.

Then I ran the command: dpgk --get-selections | grep openssh install.
This time the result was:

openssh-client
openssh-server
openssh-sftp-server

which is what we want.

I ran the comman ssh-keygen, and created my passphrase:
"I like to walk my dog".

Then I ran: sudo useradd -d /home/client_dir to
create a directory for my client. I cd'd to that directory
and ran: sudo mkdir .ssh.

I then added a client user by running:
sudo useradd -d /home/client_dir -m client

and created the password using:
sudo passwd client.
I made the password: "client".

I had my partner run ifconfig to check his ip address.
I ran:
ssh-copy-id -i user1@10.97.85.180

A window then came up prompting me to write my passphrase,
which I did.

I was then connected to my partners desktop via ssh.

I opened emacs to test that it worked, and it did.

We then repeated the process with my partner logging into
my desktop.
