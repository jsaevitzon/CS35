1) If another team had access to all the bytes going across the network
then we should still be fine. This is because all information being
transmitted across the network is already encrypted and can only be
decrypted by certain pgp keys. It would be virtually impossible for
any hacker to decrypt a 256-bit encrypted text paragraph, no matter
how long it is. This only protects throught the network though, not
when someone has access to the computer or keyboard.

If a hacker had access to a USB, this would be a different story. They
could vry well use that to track key strokes or other activity that
would make it easier to decipher movement. This would be much less secure.

2) gpg --verify only verifies that nobody else has messed with the file
since the person who sent it sent it. However, it cannot verify that the
person who we believed sent it, actually sent it. Thus, anybody could have
actually sent it, but all we can do is verify that nobody accessed it once
it has been sent, not that the wrong person sent it.
