Used locale commad, output was LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8", so I used export LC_ALL='C' to set to standard C locale. Now, output from locale command says LC_TYPE='C'.

I used the command "sort -o words /usr/share/dict/words" to create the sorted words text. I then used "mv words cs35/ass2" to move it into my folder.

I used the command "wget web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring16/cs35L/assign/assign2.html" to download the website.

The command "cat assign2.html | tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'" changes all characters not in the ranges from A-Z and a-z (non-alphabetic) to newline characters. Has many lines in between each word, only one word per line.


The command "cat assign2.html |	tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'"	changes	all characters not in the ranges from A-Z and a-z (non-alphabetic) to newline characters, but has no more than one word per line and no empty lines in between words.

The command "cat assign2.html | tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*] | sort" behaves identical to "cat assign2.html | tr-c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'" EXCEPT for the former sorts all the words in alphabetical order.

The command "cat assign2.html | tr-c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*] | sort -u" does the same thing as the command directly above it, however it causes each word to be repeated and outputted no more than once (caused by -u).

The command "cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words" outputs................

The command "cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words" ouputs a column of words that are unique to assig2.html by removing columns 2 and 3 from the above ouput.

"touch hwords" to create the 'hwords' file.
